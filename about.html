    <h1>About the Owners</h1>
    <img src="owners.jpeg" alt="Owners" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <p>Woodmoore is currently owned by 2 brothers, Jaswant Singh and Surinder Singh.<br>
    Both brothers immigrated to the USA viewing it as the land of opporunities. It would turn out to be just that.<br>
    They first stayed in New York until 2008, working various jobs.<br>
    They worked in restaurants and delis before making the decision of driving the ever-famous NYC yellow taxis.<br>
    They moved from New York to Maryland in 2008 and opening their own food store here, York's Pizza Subs and Wings in Baltimore. It was a huge success.<br>
    After almost a decade, they sold it and bought Woodmoore from extended family and have been running it ever since making multiple new additions.</p>
